      What makes a user click an ad? In digital advertising, two things need to happen: the user must
      <strong>see</strong> the ad, and the ad must be <strong>compelling</strong> enough to
      act on. In other words, clickability decomposes into two independent factors:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Viewability</strong> ($V$) &mdash; how likely is it that the ad is actually seen?</li>
      <li><strong>Quality</strong> ($Q$) &mdash; given the ad is seen, how relevant and persuasive is it?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This post formalizes that intuition. Starting from first principles, we derive
      a decomposition of the observed click-through rate:
    </p>

    $$P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}) = Q \cdot \bigl[\, V + r \cdot (1 - V) \,\bigr]$$

    <p>
      where $r \in (0,1)$ is a small false-click factor accounting for accidental or bot clicks on
      unseen ads. The derivation makes precise what advertisers mean when they say an ad
      &ldquo;performs well&rdquo; &mdash; and where the levers actually are.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <p>
      In this framework, we consider three random variables and one latent event:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>click</strong> &mdash; the user clicks on the ad</li>
      <li><strong>context</strong> &mdash; the publication context (site, position, device, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>view</strong> &mdash; the ad is actually seen by the user (latent)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The quantity we often observe in logs is $P(\text{click} \mid \text{context})$,
      but what we really care about is the <em>true</em> click rate conditioned on the ad
      being viewed: $P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \text{view})$.
    </p>

    <h2>Derivation</h2>

    <p>
      Start from the joint probability and marginalize over the latent view event:
    </p>

    $$P(\text{click}, \text{context}) = P(\text{click},\text{context}, \text{view}) + P(\text{click},\text{context}, \neg\text{view})$$

    <p>
      Applying the Bayes' rule to each term:
    </p>

    $$P(\text{click}, \text{context}) = P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \text{view})\, P(\text{context}, \text{view}) + P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \neg\text{view})\, P(\text{context}, \neg\text{view})$$

    <p>
      Dividing both sides by $P(\text{context})$:
    </p>

    $$P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}) = P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \text{view})\, P(\text{view} \mid  \text{context}) + P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \neg\text{view})\, P(\neg\text{view} \mid \text{context})$$

    <h2>Viewability and the false-click factor</h2>

    <p>
      We introduce two quantities to simplify the expression:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Viewability index.</strong> The probability that a displayed ad is actually viewed in a given context:
    </p>

    $$V = P(\text{view} \mid \text{context})$$

    <p>
      <strong>False-click factor.</strong> A scalar $r \in [0, 1]$ that captures the ratio of
      click probability when the ad is <em>not</em> viewed versus when it is:
    </p>

    $$P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \neg\text{view}) = r \cdot P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \text{view})$$

    <p>
      False clicks can be attributed to multiple factors such as accidental clicks, bots.
      When $r = 0$, users never click ads they haven't seen (the ideal case).
      When $r > 0$, there is some residual click rate from accidental clicks, bot traffic,
      or misattributed events. In practise we can expect $r$ to be negligible overall.
    </p>

    <p>
      Substituting into the boxed equation and writing
    </p>
      $$Q = P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}, \text{view})$$

    <p>
      leading to the final identity
    </p>

    $$\boxed{P(\text{click} \mid \text{context}) = Q \cdot \bigl[\, V + r \cdot (1 - V) \,\bigr]}$$

    <p>
      The term in brackets is a <strong>viewability correction factor</strong>. It tells us how much
      of the true CTR is preserved in the observed CTR, as a function of viewability $V$ and
      false-click rate $r$.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpretation</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When $V = 1$ (every displayed ad is viewed), the correction factor equals $1$ regardless
        of $r$, and the observed CTR matches the true CTR.
      </li>
      <li>
        When $V = 0$ (no ad is viewed), the correction factor equals $r$ &mdash; the observed
        CTR is purely from false clicks.
      </li>
      <li>
        For intermediate values, the correction factor interpolates linearly between $r$ and $1$.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visualisation</h2>

    <p>
      The plot below shows the correction factor $V + r\,(1 - V)$ as a function of viewability $V$,
      for several values of the false-click factor $r$.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <h2>Conclusion: two levers for clickability</h2>

    <p>
      The decomposition $\text{CTR} = Q \cdot [V + r(1-V)]$ separates clickability into two
      fundamentally different problems that require different solutions:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Viewability $V$</strong> is a <em>supply-side</em> quantity. It depends on where
      the ad is placed (above or below the fold), on which device it is rendered, and on user
      scroll behaviour. Improving $V$ is about better inventory selection, page layout, and
      ad placement strategy. It has nothing to do with the ad creative itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Quality $Q$</strong> is a <em>demand-side</em> quantity. It captures how relevant
      the ad is to the user, how persuasive the creative is, and whether the landing page
      delivers on the promise. Improving $Q$ is about better targeting, creative optimization,
      and audience understanding. It has nothing to do with the placement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conflating the two leads to poor decisions. An ad with high $Q$ on a low-$V$ placement
      will show a low observed CTR &mdash; not because the ad is bad, but because nobody sees
      it. Conversely, a mediocre ad on a premium above-the-fold spot ($V \approx 1$) will
      expose its low $Q$ directly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the <a href="ad-viewability-decomposition.html">next post</a>, we decompose $V$
      itself into structural (scroll depth, fold position) and attentional (saliency, creative
      size) components.
